# matlab-linear-programming-solver
A MATLAB program to solve linear programming using simplex method and plot the solution region.
## Linear Programming
[**Linear programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming). (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.
## Simplex Method
[**Simplex method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm), Standard technique in linear programming for solving an optimization problem, typically one involving a function and several constraints expressed as inequalities. The inequalities define a polygonal region (see polygon), and the solution is typically at one of the vertices.
